### list of all the things that I would want to see in an Home improvement Rasperry PI

1. Home Monitoring
	a. Have the Raspberry PI start a low quality video stream and backup to mega.nz. 
	b. Everyday, before starting delete the videos that were backed up a day before.
	c. Ability to send a picture based of the state of the home based on an event, if it's text (or) it's a command or ability to access it when not connected to local WIFI

2. Climate and Transport schedule monitoring
	a. Read the temperature of the zip code and give us necessary inputs as to what the temperature is and give a shoutout at around 7 AM and 10 AM everyday.
	b. Also if a train route is the mode of transport, then give a warning around 30 mins before the departure of the train.
	c. Ability to configure the rail/car scheduling, make a webserver that listens on some port to acheive this. 

3. Important date monitoring
	a. Ability to read out the significance of a particular day. 
		1. For example, play a greeting on love (or) a poem on love for valentines
	b. Remind us of birthday's and important days of life.
	c. Use another endpoint from 2C to do this.

4. Entertainment
	a. Read commands to play songs.
		1. First search sound cloud to check for the song. 
		2. Then check youtube to check for the same song and play it.
	b. Read commands and play videos
		1. Do the same as 2a for youtube videos.
		2. Also have a programmable API to play videos from the local servers hard disk.
